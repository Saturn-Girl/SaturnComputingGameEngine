# About the Creator
Hi! I’m an 11-year-old game developer in Grade 7 (Section Paul) who’s passionate about:

Old tech

Anime

Minecraft portals

RollerCoaster Tycoon

GTA

Wiring

And making awesome stuff!

I know and use tons of languages:
PHP, Dart, GML, Python, x86 Assembly, VBScript, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, C++/C, C#, Ruby, Rust, R, Lua, Scratch, and Adacraft.

Yep — I’m a young dev who commutes to school, codes like crazy, and loves building things from scratch (no pun intended 😂).

# Final Note
Yes, I’m young. Yes, I’m serious. I’m making engines, not just playing games.
Thanks for checking out SaturnComputingGameEngine! ❤️
